Now that you have created some tickets. You can logout of osTicket and log in as one of the agents that you created to look at the tickets that have been created by the end users. Here depending on the agents access, they are able to assign it to the proper SLA, tranfer it to a different departmente and update the priority.

<p>As you make changes to these different categories you can see the changes are captured as notes. Ensure you leave commentary on the ticket and post reply so the department knows its being worked on.
